# My thoughts on money

I make good money, as people in my line of work tend to. I'm definitley not above average within my social circle in SF —since lately I've been working at startups with little care to pay-cuts— but definitely more above average for software engineers worldwide. The Bay pays well.

My income has gone up, down and sideways owing to various job changes, without much of an effect to my lifestyle. And that's by choice and conviction. I believe money exists to buy yourself a life of your choosing, and it just so happens that the life I want is quite cheap.

I'm not planning my life around the [FIRE](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-independence-retire-early-fire.asp) philosophy. I'm not frugal for the sake of ridding myself of labour. I simply

# I buy what I need

One needs luxuries; living by one's needs doesn't mean living on the bare-minimum. One needs pleasures, conveniences and rewards. But not always.

# Money is a vehicle for social relationships

And it just so happens my social relationsips aren't particularly "expensive". I'm from a middle-class family in Mexico so we don't socialize around much money. We don't pertake on expensive hobbies or trips; we have a great time just with a big shared meal and each other's company. Same thing goes for most of my friends in Mexico.

My friendships get more expensive in San Francisco, but even there, the formula is similar. A meal, a good chat and quality time together. An ocassional trip. Oveall though, though a process of self-selection, given my lack of interst in hobbies like snowboarding or idk, golf— I've realized I vibe well with people who I can build connection via honest conversation and company, more so than particularly expensive activities.

# Liberty

Back in 2018, I worked with a guy at Facebook who had nothing in his desk. The rest of us made good use of the limitless requests we could send to IT and had dual monitors, keyboards, mice and other aparatuses, but this guy just worked off his laptop in a bare, white surface every day.

We of course asked him why. He wanted a remote job eventually, so he avoided all the spoils of an office on purpose, so he wouldn't feel like he needed them once he got the chance to work while away.

This resonates with me. Not in that same context— I'll use a monitor, a mouse and a keyboard when available— but in a broader context. Materialism is slavery.

We get used to a lifestyle, habits, "thigns" and powers, and ultimeatley
