# New York

I moved from New York to Palo Alto, and get asked often, not rarely aghast, why.

I'm not going to write a blog post about why I didn't like New York, that's a conversation to be had with a friend over hot food or a cold drink. You need to know me both to understand and to get me to repeat it out loud for the 20th time.

Today I (thankfully) didn't have that conversation, but I did remember that I once had it every day, internally, with myself. It was the mull that comes before every big decision, wondering if it's the right one or the wrong one. I treat this blog like writing to the void and as far as I know, it is; but on the off-chance someone stumbles across this on the internet, and amongst the thousands of signs that are saying "stay", I think it's valuable to share that New York sucks actually and in hindsight moving out is one of the decisions I'd most quickly re-take.

All the reasons you think it sucks, they're true. Not everyone has to believe them, just you. Yes, there is a deluge on content singing the reasons why New York is so great, from stats on urban transit to of course literal songs. It's hard to believe they're all wrong, it's easy to believe you're just not doing something correctly.

But there's something deeper, and you know what it is. And in spite of the opinions of those transplants you might chit-chatted with after class or at a bar, there are other cities out there.

It's thrilling to imagine all that could happen at the turn of a corner. You could meet love at the subway. You could

That happens everywhere. Luck is an attitude, not

There will be doubt when moving out. You'll feel that you've finally made it; isn't this the dream everyone talks about? You're walking the streets that've built so many great people in the land of oportunity. You'll think of your favourite artist, and how they had a formative period in New York. Everyone loves being there.

For me, it was Lin Manuel Miranda; "In New York you can be a new man".

You can also be a new man outside New York. New York has capital

New York has an effect on people, especially the sort of effect on people, especially the kind that choose to pay $2000+ USD to live with a roomate and without a closet.
