# About

Midnight Joke is a blog by [Kevin Chavez](https://twitter.com/aykev).

It's called Midnight Joke after a song I like by [Takako Mamiya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUzKRfDsP1U). I made a [remix](https://soundcloud.com/mr-onion/takako-mamiya-yoru-ni) of it and used the soundcloud link to test this blogging platform in one of the [first posts](./midnight-joke). It's also a blog I won't take too seriously, predominantly written past midnight.

It's an experiment in self-publishing, and I guess in [static-site generation](./yip) too.
