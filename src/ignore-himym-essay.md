1. Realism

[ESTABLISH: that the show is realistic becuase it's narrated from Ted's point of view, and that everything should be interpreted as Ted's point of view]

The inherent idiosyncrasies of a sitcom thus don't have to be interpreted as strictly unrealistic aspects of yet another sitcom. We can relax our suspension of disbelief, and read them as

Who, especially if in a good spot in their lives, doesn't remember the past through fond, nostalic goggles? Who doesn't remember and narrate the wild parties wilder than they probably were? Who doesn't remember the good times all that more funnier, and the sad times with an air of positivity that ultimately led to the good spot in life one's in? Ted is clearly happy— he became a succesful architect (?), and most importantly married and had two kids with the love of his life. He doesn't have regrets about his past and he makes this clear throught the episodes, the ups and the downs and everything in between made him the man he is. Any man in that circumstance would narrate their past like a sitcom, especially one as romatic and optimistic and Ted has been established to be.

What we are seein on-screen is Ted's narration of his past, not Ted's past. There's clear areas where this fact is used as a fun gag, or even a key element to drive the mystery of the story (EXAMPLE: GOAT EPISODE, TED ALONE EPISODE, TED MIXING STORIES LILLY AND BARNEY ARE MAD AT EACH OHTER EPISODE). There's other moments where one can make a subtle interpretation of this.

For example, episode (TODO). When Barney drops the final pre-nup and gets ready to read it with Quinn, it plays out as a fun sitcom gag. It can be attributed to exagerated narration too, something like: "Barney told me the final pre-nup was a huge stack of paper, so long neither wanted to read it. It made them wonder if they really trusted each other". How tall is a stack of paper like this, especially if you didn't see it yourself?

In this same episode we see we see Victoria's ex-fiancé living with them, and we're presented with a funny image of an over-the-top German and always naked man who is oblivious to social cues, impossibly thin apartment walls, but a happy ending where they all have fun waching TV. This of course triggers our suspension of diesbelief— it's just a sitcom, and this is a fun gag. There's no way this guy was nude all the time, the walls were so thin, or they all had such a good time together in the end.

Yet, we can make sense of this beyond the interpretation of exagerated and XXXXX sitcom wringing, and instead artifacts of Ted's narration of his version of the story: "Ugh, and [HANS?] was naked all the time, I couldn't handle it! The walls in that apartment were so thin too— he could literally hear everything we said in our bedroom. I was so annoyed by his German accent, and he couldn't catch a cue. He liked the lamest German show, but in the end I guess the show turned out to be pretty funny."

This makes HIMYM suprisingly realistic. Not becuase the story as it is being narrated is realistic, but becuase it has this clever literary device to account for its lack of realism. The writers know this, and play extensively with this device at times, even making it a central part of the plot in more than one ocasion. [GOAT EXAMPLE HERE PERHAPS]. It's still over-the-top; Barney is an extremely rich young guy with impossible skills for seduction, but is he really that rich and that seductive, or is that just coming from a guy that is easy to impress and is way worse with women? Lilly and Marshall are an impossibly cute, loyal and mature couple; but are they really that good, or is that just coming from Marshall's best friend, and a guy who wanted to find that for himself?

This is important to consider when thinking about the ending, becuase more than other shows, one can afford interpret HIMYM in a realistic manner. Other sitcoms have to be viewed throughout by the rules they set and in the world they build.

In the Office for example, a world where antics that would get you fired or arrested are not only commonplace, but endearing. A world where the employees of Dundler Mifflin (?) don't seem to have much of a life, family or friends outside of work, and so the relationships they form within work, in spite of all their flaws, become valuable. Therefore, a world where Jim and Pam quit, but Dwight, in spite of sufferening from many years of bullying by them, gives them severance packages for example.

In friends, a world so light-hearted and lesfaire (?) that Monica can break Joey an Chandler's fooseball table without repercussions, where someone on the phone saying there's a problem with the "left phalange" of the plane can evacuate a plane without consequences, and where people can just "realize" they love someone with a ton of red flags out of the blue (?).

, or the impossibliy odd situations characters in friends find themselves in at times (see, Chandler getting )

Underneath the good feelings and funny memories, there's deeper characterizations of the characters though, hinted at both by their actions and their stoires.

2. The Characters

[ESTABLISH: that the relationship between the characters is more complex than it seems. Ted loves, admires, hates Barney. Robin is worse than she seems, but we don't see it bc Ted likes her]

### Barney

Barney is the most interesting character. He's certianly the most over-the-top,

3. The ending

[ESTABLISH: follows the trend of realistic lessons about love with a final lesson, sometimes happily ever after isn't happily ever after. A wedding isn't the end, it's just the beggining]
-> [VIA: Robin and Barney's divorce. Love ends]
-> [VIA: Tracy's death. Life gets in the way]
-> [VIA: Marshall and Lilly still together. Fairytale love sometimes exists]

[ESTABLISH: Ted is not making the same error again. Circumstances are different; ted wanted and now has kids, Robin can't have them. They're looking for different things to when they were younger]

[ESTABLISH: Robin and Ted don't have to be a good couple for the ending to be good. The undefined ending is the only possible realistic ending. We don't know what life brings. Final lesson is Ted's optimism— he didn't lose it after all these years. Uplifiting that the "love game" isn't something stuck in your 20s]

4. Foreword

A word about why I think I automatically this ending, but a lot of people don't.

My mom and dad divorced when I was about 8 years old. It was a turbulent time in my life for sure, and I'm sure I still carry scars from it, but it led to my mom and my stepdad finding each other and marrying. I hear about their ups and ocassional downs, but they're still together.

I think this whole event and all the times I talked with my mom about it instilled in me, in a very real and personal way, those last lesson HIMYM teaches its viewers. That life is unpredictable, that marriage far from being the end is the beggining, and that life goes on, and love isn't a "20's game".

In a world flush with finales that bank on grand demonstrations of love for the emotional punch and sense of closure that audiences expect, this finale felt like a breath of fresh air. Something smart, instead of cheap. It is a little hasty, but it is smart.
