title: Disney "Primos" & knowing your audience
---

This theme song for an upcoming Disney show called "Primos" recently caused quite some backslash.

The creator shared some instagram stories, in which she told haters to "be mad", claiming there's people who need to watch this show, too bad for people who didn't like it. She's Mexican American.

This gets at the bottom of what I think the real issue is here. Aside from the stereotypical sepia tones so often associated with anything to do with Mexicans, I didn't find this song very cringe-worthy. I could tell this show isn’t about Mexicans— it’s about Mexican-Americans.

I've in the USA quite some time and have interacted enought with the Mexican American comunity there to notice as much. Crucially however —and what I think is the real sin this show commited— this fact not clear anywhere in the this theme song.

Of course people who are not Mexican-American would think the show is about them and feel misrepresented. They have enough cultural cues to believe this show is about them: the spanish, the looks, the big-family theme, etc. But this show isn't a look at the life of someone who is Mexican, Chilean, Bolivian, Colombian, Venezuelan, Guatemalan etc. It's a look at the life of someone who is Mexcian-American (or perhaps more broadly Hispanic-American).

If Disney's reach were limited to the USA, I’d call this unwarranted internet hate. Disney's reach is global though. Creators need to be careful and clear of who they’re depicting and what their audience is, becuase it's certainly understandable that otherwise backslash like this will happen. To a Mexican, this looks like an awful attempt by disney at depicting Mexicans. To a Colombian it might look like an awfully wrong depiction of Colombians. To a Chilean, like an awful depcition of Chileans, etc.

This confusion can be noticed in one of the criticisms of the show. There's a girl named cuca, and a her little sister (?) is named cuquita (little cuca).

Plenty of tweets have made fun of the show for calling a character the slang term for pussy. This immediately comes off as ignorant Americans not caring about doing a little research before making a show supposedly of and for Latin American people. I don't view it that way, because "cuca" is Dominican slang for pussy, but not Mexican. Here, it's just a normal nickname for people. I know someone who goes by Cuca! The show doesn't make clear where the characters come from or who the audience is, and so it's easy to see how people from the Dominican Republic, will watch this and think the show is poorly addressed to them.

Similarly, the gramatically wrong "Oye, primos!". The correct way to translate "Hey, cousins!" to spanish is "Oigan, primos!", since "primos" is plural. Gramatical errors like this are common, and even staple in some cases of Mexican-American spanish. I think that's fine, one can understand the meaning and the origin— in english there's no distinction after all:

- Hey, you!
- Hey, people!

Plural or singular, it's the same "hey"! I compare this kind of easy-to-make if you're coming with another language, but easy-to-understand error to a non-native English speaker saying "I drinked all the water" for example. It's a fairly inoffensive mistake.

Nonetheless, to people who didn't grow up around the idiosyncracies of Mexican-American Spanish, this, once again, immediately comes off as ignorant Americans not caring about doing a little research before writing the lyrics for this show's theme song. "Did they bother having a spanish speaker in the room?" What to Mexican-Americans could be an identifying feature, to non-American hispanics can come off as misrepresentative, if they believe the aim was to represent them.

Things to consider if you’re exporting your show around the world
