# A Decade of Birthdays

When I think of my last few birthdays, I remember not only how lucky I am, but also how many different places life has taken me:

- 20 I celebrated in `Guadalajara`, at my grandma’s place with my family, because it’s why I always did up to that point, and I didn’t know the world I was about to dive into
- 21 I celebrated in `New York`, with fellow interns and a recruiter. They liked the excuse to drink. I had my second legal drink in the second country to allow me to.
- 22 I celebrated in `San Francisco`, at a club. Nobody knew it’s my birthday. I have kept in touch with the music more than with that crew.
- 23 I celebrated in `Vancouver`, with my friends. I didn’t tell anyone again, but they still found out.
- 24 I celebrated in `Lawrence`, with my then girlfriend. It was a good relationship, she cared about me.
- 25 I celebrated in `Palo Alto`, with the girl I was then seeing. It wasn’t a great relationship, we broke up soon after.
- 26 I celebrated in `Tlaquepaque`, with my brother during the pandemic. A true relationship, I hope to have him in my life forever.
- 27 I celebrated in `Puerto Vallarta`, with my friends. I wonder if we’ll ever have a trip like that, all of us, again.
- 28 I celebrated in `Mountain View`, with my then girlfriend. A good relationship, she cares about me. We’re still friends.
- 29 I celebrated in `London`, with my mate Ajay Gandhi, at the Ministry of Sound. Saw the sunrise as I thought of home.

Every birthday in my 20’s I celebrated at a different postal code, in a different way, with different people. After 10 different places, across 4 different countries and 2 continents however, I think 30 is a good time to wrap it up, end the streak, close the cycle.

- 30 I will celebrate in `Guadalajara`, at my grandma’s place with my family, because I haven’t in 10 years. I now know the world out there, the one I dove into, and I’ve chosen to come back.

I will try my best to think back to that 20th birthday. I can remember little about it to be honest, since back then it wasn’t really special. Everyone will be 10 years older than the last time I celebrated my birthday there, that’s for sure, but back then, what I was hoping to see? What was I hoping to do? What worrying me, and what was motivating me?

The world feels smaller, time feels shorter, and I do feel older. It’ll be nice to be home.
