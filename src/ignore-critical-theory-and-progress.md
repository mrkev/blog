# Progress & The Goal

I took a class in college that challenged my worldview, and philosophically shaped me more in about 4 months than any other formal education.

It was Introduction to Critical Theory, listed under a few subjects of which I assume Philosophy was one, but remember none except German Studies. Amongst other ideas, whilist discussing Kant and Hagel a question was posed: why does "progress" even matter?

Of course that wasn't how the question was presented and it wasn't even something we spent too long on in class, but as an engineering student this took an axe to a foundational belief deeply ingrained in me. It's almost axiomatic that "progress" simply mattered. Progress was good, all of it, all the time. Economic progress, scientific progress, technological progress, they are _the goal_ — and we are good at it. No century saw more economic, scientific or technological growth than the past 100 years. We got electric vaccum cleaners, found over a thousand exoplanets, built at least three generational iterations of phones, a huge network or roads and the internet. In a congruent fashion, when studying history's heroes, alongside great generals and important artists we learn about brilliant scientists who seemingly single-handedly advanced technological progress in such an unproportional fashion it has merrited inmortality in student essays for centuries to come.

And for good reason! Today we have machines and supply chains that can afford building computers as cheap as shoes. Is it not better for everyone to have a computer? Is it not better for everyone to be able to get any information immediately? Or to get from one point to another without walking? Or to have machines that can extend our lives and push back death itself?

From what I recall this was all brought up and the professor agreed with plenty of it, though in classic philosophical fashion opinions and "certain truths" are of little importance, and he was way more concerned with taking all these to the test. Why do we need information more quickly? Why is it better to get somewhere moving as little as possible? Why is it so important we scavange back those last few years from the clawas of death? Why have we agreed, not only as a species, but also personally and individually that this is what matters?

And I mean, it's true. I came to the United States to study and then work because this is the capital of progress in technology. Everywhere else seems to be importing more "tech" than they export. I deeply, agreed with the premise that this sort of personal sacrifice was worth the eventual technological progress I could then produce. I believed there was intrisic glory in being a forebarer?todo of this progress. Building science or technology was human wealth, and it was worth it.

I learned a historical philosophic perspective to this worldview that day; one that connects it, with other ferverish and domatic ideologies, like religion— because like religion it exists because it gives us comfort. We have always been scared of nature. It was a lion at some point, or a flood that caught us by surprise. We learned to tame those, but then our fears got more abstract. We fear ignorance because we can't control what we don't know. We fear distance, so we try to put the whole world into reach. At the end of the day we fear death; perhaps no longer that it could hide behind a bush, but we still fear it because when it eventually comes we don't know what will happen, and we can't control it. As a civilizaiton we can't control it; there is an end to time, and it's approaching.

Progress has tamed nature. It has put us in control of our hunger, our environment, it has pushed back our fear. Heck, nature fears us now. Capital gives us control. But when face the reality of it, enlightment just gives us a chance to fight a battle in a war we can't win. Nature will always win. No matter how much we control, we can't control everything. No matter how much liberty we have, we are at the mercy of forces beyond us. No matter how good our medicine gets, eventually we face death, someone else's or our own, as will the eventual last person to be.

Have we progressed, if the result is the same? And if it's not, if we've learned to not be afraid, has it been thanks to our smartphones and $2 cheeseburers, or thanks to something else?

That course deeply touched me for many reasons, but amongst them this new perspective on progress; a social one. One where an advanced society isn't one with faster computers, it's one with less fear. One where progress isn't in GDP or patents, but in the will to live. And honestly, it's interesting to think that there is little data to prove the most advanced societies in the world exist today. I don't know if the matriarchical Iroquois League lived in less fear and with more purpose back in 1345. Their world was smaller and they had a [Great Law of Peace](TODO). Had they come to terms with their problems? What did they think of our mortality?

In retrospect it's kind of obvious progress has nothing to do with technology or science when we consider how steadily these have improved but what a long dark age of colonialism, suffering, patriarchy and fear we're just now leaving behind. Nonetheless at times it's unclear wether or not we're entering another though, after all how does one rationalize our way of living while we're actively destroying the natural systems that keep the planet's beauty and complexity alive.

Not long after this I had a final round of interviews with Facebook that I went on to bomb, and I can't say this conversation didn't play a role in this. I'm pretty sure I briefly considered leaving tech altogether.
