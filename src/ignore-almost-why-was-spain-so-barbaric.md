# Why was Spain so barbaric in the New World?

The world changed in 1492 when Cristopher Columbus discovered America— I think there’s no questioning that. I do think though, a lot of people take the atrocities that ensued for granted, as something that was "bound to happen".

I disagree with that notion. The Conquest could've been less violent, genocidal, or absolute than it was. Nothing about two peoples meeting for the first time dictates the one will raze the other's cities to the ground, enslave its population, or attempt to so fully destroy its culture and religion. Famed Chinese Admiral Zheng He for example made contact with many a people in his Seven Voyages between 1405 and 1433. Tributes were requested, and at times Kings who refuesed were abudcted, but no genocide happened.

I think rather there were characteristics unique to Spain at the turn of the Reconquista that led to this indiscriminate display of barbarism. Had Zheng He encountered the Aztecs instead of Columbus, we would live in a world with a Sino-America, but alas that didn't happen. Below I talk about these characteristics.

## 1. The Conquest Mentality

Spain was in the conquest mentality. It’s easy to assume any European kingdom would be, but Spain, IMO, was a special case. It was really in it. The most important event in Spanish history to happen in 1492 might actually not be the discovery of America, but rather the culmination of the “Reconqiuista”. The territory that’s now Spain and Portugal used to be al-Andalus, part of the Muslim Caliphate. It had been so since 711.

Spain was in fact "brand new" in 1492— it didn’t exist until 1469, when two (fervently catholic, an important detail I will further explore later) monarchs married, uniting León and Aragón to create a unified kingdom they called Spain. This unified kingdom was powerful enough to finally fulfill its territorial ambition, and so they did. The Emirate of Granada had been the last Muslim kingdom in Iberia, holding it’s territory since at least the 1200s, but the unified kingdom defeated and kicked them out after a 10 year (1482-1492) war.

This brand new experiment of a nation, Spain, was born in a mentality of war with the purpose of expansion. It was created in the first place to combine military power to fight and conquer. The very same year Columbus found America they wrapped up their final conquest, and were fresh for new territory to take.

2. The Racist Mentality

TODO: Persians and Mongols

It’s 1449 in Toledo, Spain and an edict has just been published. It’s the first instance in modern history of discriminatory laws based on race. The so called Sentencia-Estatuto, followed many decades of discrimination against Jews. Some of these Jews converted to Christianism, and became known as “conversos”, but in an interesting turn of events which gave rise to growing concerns and discourse about “purity of blood”, these laws, the Sentencia-Estatuto, barred conversos, from holding private or public office or receiving land from the church benefices, unless they could prove four generations of Christian affiliation.

Conversos were Christian. Their parents could be Christian. Their grandparents could be christian. But the “blood” from their great-grandparents, could be enough to deem them lesser. Mind you, Jewish people who claimed to be Christian but secretly practiced Judaism were called “marranos” (either from "marrar”, meaning to err or deviate, or the literal word “marrano” which means swine).

The Spanish weren’t only concerned by the Jewish. As previously discussed, there was a long-standing campaign to kick the Moors from Spain. In 1492, when the Reconquista ended, Muslims and Sephardic Jews were required to convert to Catholicism or leave the country. After converting, Christians of Muslim heritage were referred to as moriscos, meaning Moor-like.

If the concern of the Spanish had been purely religious, conversion would’ve been enough for integration, but these “tags” and classification of people, plus the not only wether you were Christian, but wether your ancestors were, point at a deeper concern. One related to the purity of blood, that would eventually lead to the common use of the term limpieza, translated to “purity of the blood” in English, by the 1500s

Once again, it’s interesting to see then that that was the mentality of this brand new experiment of a nation— generational purity, abhorrence of “the others”, and even president of encoding this abhorrence in the law. In the new world they met perhaps the most different people they could’ve bumped into. Spain wasn’t going to do like the Persians, or the Mongols. Not with these nascent ideas of generational purity.

3. The Divine Superiority Mentality

From these past two points we can already see the third, and probably most explosive factor leading to the intense barbarism of Spain in the New World. Spain was fanatically catholic. We’re talking divine right, religious superiority, manifest destiny, “catholic jihad” levels of catholic. So fervently catholic, they codified the first modern “racist laws” based on the idea that your heritage could be tarnished by the religion of grandparents. So catholic, that they established in 1478 (only 9 years after the country first came to be) the famous Spanish Inquisition. And of course, as previously mentioned, that first decree in 1942 ordering Jews and Muslims to convert to Catholicism, leave Castile, or face death.

The Islamic Republic of Iran is feverishly Muslim. It implements Sharia’a law and will punish blasphemy with death. Ex-Muslim atheists have been harassed. Adherents of the Baháʼí Faith are often prosecuted. Even in this context, there is space for very limited religious freedom. Five seats in the parliament are reserved for the minority religions; 2 for Armenian Christians, 1 for Assyrian and Chaldean Christians together, 1 for Jews, and 1 for Zoroastrians.

In 1492 Spain, there was no tolerance. In 1494 the monarchs took the title of “Catholic King and Queen”, and they were militant about it. But is it surprising, when the creation of the country was motivated by a war against people of a different religion? Or in the context of the previously described animosity against Jews?

So that’s the mentality that gave rise to brand nation was in— belief in a single religion, intolerance, and war against blasphemy. It was the such an important characteristic to the foundation of Spain, its founders chose not to be remembered as “The Unifying Monarchs” or “The First Kings of Spain”. Not even as “The victors of the 781 year conflict to conquer Iberia”. They chose to be remembered as “The Catholic King and Queen” and give death to non-Catholics if necessary.

This is the context and mentality in Spain in that fateful year, 1942, when Columbus first landed in America. A state fresh out of war. I don’t know if in debt or not, but certainly in the mindset of expansion and conquest. A state with a nascent concept of “blood purity”. But most importantly, a nation with a quest to christianize, zealous ideas of Catholic superiority, and little concern for tolerance.

The rest is history— when faced with conquerable land, a people they could consider inferior, and the opportunity to evangelize, Spain took it. Brutally. What followed is the biggest genocide in history, the biggest religious campaign in history, the biggest wealth transfer in history, and in the interest of challenging Spain, a race by Europe not only to brutally conquer other peoples, but to justify their brutal conquering of other peoples. It’s hardly surprising that the seeds for racism present in Spain became widespread and systematized racism throughout Europe, when it turned out to be so profitable. Or that the Protestant Reformation became such a big schism in Christianity, when there was so much to gain in challenging Catholic power, and in brewing new ideas and philosophies to make sense of the expansionism taking place.

So we got a God that was less politically involved in England and Germany. We got Calvin, we got Locke. We got more focus, especially in protestant nations, on the individual and a personal sense of morality. We got the enlightenment, and further challenge of the church. We got the French Revolution, and challenge of institutions claiming divine right. We saw the rise of the rule of law, and private enterprise over weakened political institutions. We saw the Industrial Revolution rise with unregulated capitalism. We saw Marx and Engles. We saw the modern world.

But I’m getting ahead of myself— I don’t know how the modern world would look had this experiment of a nation in this very specific state of mind not encountered the new world, but I do think there’s a good argument to say what happened in the New World was not inevitable, or an unavoidable product not of the actors, but of human nature. It wasn’t. It was a very specific state, in a very specific zeitgeist, in the fateful year of 1942.

————————————————

We had to believe in something, so we chose to believe in progress.

XV century Spain was intensely political, militaristic and expansionist

or the takeover by European Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula

- the racist mentality (peninsular vs moors)
- the divine superiority mentality (catholic fanaticism, inquisition)

Spain tilts the European balance of power, all others ofc follow suit to tilt it back
