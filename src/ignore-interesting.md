"I personally wouldn't mind if things got a little less interesting for a little while"

Me neither. Not in the context of this video that is. I wish things got more interesting in other regards. More architecure, different ways of building cities and thinking about buildings. More music and cool daring art; we've seen a golden era on series and moviemaking recently, but what about other things? Have we had any great poetry in a while? Or any great classical composer, printmaker, muralist or dancer?

Unfortunatley things get interesting where there's money, and capital is still pouring in tech. IMO we need to slow down there a little idk.
