Me neither.

I wish things got more interesting in other regards. More architecure, different ways of building cities and thinking about buildings. More music and cool daring art that acutally means something; we've seen a golden era on series and moviemaking recently, but what about other things? Have we had any great poetry in a while? Or any great classical composer, printmaker, muralist or dancer?

Unfortunatley things get interesting where there's money, and capital is still pouring in tech. IMO it'd be ok if we all just slow down there a little. We can take our time figuring it out.
