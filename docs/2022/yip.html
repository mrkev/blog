<p>This blog is written in yip, a very opinionated blogging platform I put together because I guess that&#39;s a rabbit hole I guess I had to go down. It&#39;s built on top of <a href="https://github.com/sphido/sphido">sphido</a>, and focuses on what I need and how I think I&#39;ll like to blog. I do incorporate some cool ideas and opinions I thought would be worth a blog post about.</p>
<h2 id="1-filename-is-irrelevant">1. Filename is irrelevant</h2>
<p>One thing I dislike about some blogging platforms out there is the reliance on a specific filename format. I don&#39;t like this, because it the first thing one has to do when writing something new is to remember a format. Moreover, I don&#39;t want to relinquish control over what the URL for the blogpost will be.</p>
<p>Yip works just like a static http server. In this blog, I think I&#39;ll follow a file structure similar to:</p>
<pre><code>content/
  2022/
    yip.md
    next-post.md
  2023/
    new-year.md
    etc.md
</code></pre>
<p>To mantain a year in my URL. The &quot;Created&quot; and &quot;Revised&quot; dates at the bottom of each post are automatically generated via the file&#39;s createion and modification dates, and can be modified via a yaml header if necessary.</p>
<h2 id="2-link-variable">2. <code>link</code> variable</h2>
<p>Speaking of the yaml header, the one on <a href="TODO">this post</a> looks as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">---
created: 2012-02-12T10:43:27Z
link: https://soundcloud.com/mr-onion/takako-mamiya-yoru-ni
---
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>created</code> variable overrides the creation date rendered at the bottom of the post— I want it to be the date when the soundcloud track I shared was posted.</p>
<p>The <code>link</code> variable is interesting— something I thought up. Judging by the way I write online today, mostly in Twitter, Youtube, and other forums with comments, I can only assume a lot of my posts will be conversationalist, as a reply to content or to share content. <code>link</code> encodes this. It not only creates the embed at the top of the blog post automatically, it also represents that that post is meant and a response to whatever is linked to.</p>
<p>I think this is valuable as compared to just embedding content inline in the blog post body. I can see the possibility of more descriptive page structure and styling, but also for richer index pages.</p>
<h2 id="3-jsx-templating">3. JSX templating</h2>
<p>As of the writing of this post, the template for blog posts looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">// post.jsx
const created = page.created.toISOString().split(&quot;T&quot;)[0];
const modified = page.modified.toISOString().split(&quot;T&quot;)[0];

&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&quot;description&quot; content={page.title} /&gt;
    &lt;link
      rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;
      type=&quot;text/css&quot;
      href={page.ROOT_PATH + &quot;/css/main.css&quot;}
    /&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;{page.title}&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;.&quot;&gt;back&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    {page.embed}
    {page.content}
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    &lt;footer&gt;
      &lt;small&gt;
        &lt;i&gt;
          Created: {created}
          {modified !== created &amp;&amp; &quot;, Revised: &quot; + modified}
        &lt;/i&gt;
      &lt;/small&gt;
    &lt;/footer&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;;
</code></pre>
<p>That&#39;s it, that&#39;s the whole thing. It&#39;s a simple theme, but also... it&#39;s JSX?</p>
<p>There&#39;s plenty of HTML templating languages out there, and I&#39;m sure they&#39;re easy to pick up, but I already know JSX. I also <em>like</em> JSX, becuase it&#39;s &quot;just javascript&quot;(TM TODO), so there&#39;s no need to learn new syntax for for-loops, if&#39;s etc. JavaScript has variables, a pretty good &quot;standard library&quot;, and (IMO) a clean syntax already— why learn a completley new templating language?</p>
<p>With a little hackery and adaptation I creating this very simple JSX templating format (JSXT, or just JSX since there&#39;s no case in introducing a new file extension). I wanted it to be simple and &quot;template-y&quot; too, akin to Handlebars or Nunjucks. Part of what makes it feel &quot;template-y&quot; is you don&#39;t need to import, export, or wrap anything in a function or variable declaration. An normal HTML file is a valid JSXT file**[1], no JavaScript required.</p>

<p>Take this, put it in a static site genrator, and you&#39;ve got <code>yip</code>. You can check it out on GitHub <a href="TODO">here</a>. It is and will keep being a tool for my personal use, developed around the needs of this blog —I&#39;m not trying to take over the blogging platform space or anything— but I hope at least the ideas behind it sound interesting to some.</p>

<p>[1]: Almost. Not all valid HTML is valid JSX so technically no, but it does feel like one!</p>
